## Description

Implement function bodies. You can find them in `array.js`, `cycles.js`, `objects.js` and `strings.js` files.

We expect you to run the files using `npm start` command.
Please uncomment function calls in `index.js` as you will implement them.
Printing output into console by `console.log` may help you :-).

## Dependencies

1. [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 14
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
3. [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## First steps

1. Clone project to your computer by executing command:

   ```
   git clone git@gitlab.com:jan.havlena/lab-02.git
   cd lab-02/
   ```

   or download it as a standalone archive from [here](https://github.com/thehansys/lab-02/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. Install all required packages by running: `npm install`.
3. You are ready to develop!

## Tests

Don't forget to run prepared tests by executing `npm test` when you finish.
Even when function doesn't pass the test it doesn't mean your implementation is wrong.

## Notes

- Don't forget to comment your more complex code. It is better to read why you implemented solution like you did.
- You can call prettier to automatically format your code by running `npm run fix`.
