## Description

Implement function bodies. You can find them in `array.js`, `cycles.js`, `objects.js` and `strings.js` files. Some functions are BONUS.

We expect you to run the files using `npm start` command.
Please uncomment function calls in `index.js` as you will implement them.
Printing output into console by `console.log` may help you :-).

Please look what functions should do - either console.log or return
