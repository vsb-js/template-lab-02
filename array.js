// EXERCISE:
// You can write all the code natively (for cycles and such) or you can use some advanced functions which JS arrays provides in case you see them fit
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
// There can be multiple solutions to each task, solve it as you see fit.
// You will work with array `numbers` which will be generated by code (code below) in every task.
// Write these functions:

// This block generates array with random length with values between 1-100
export let numbers = [];
const length = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10) + 5;
for (let i = 0; i < length; i = i + 1) {
  numbers.push(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100));
}

// a) Function which will print to console a whole array
export const printArray = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:
 
};

// b) Function which will print to console the length of array
export const printLength = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:
 
};

// c) Function which will print to console the first element of array
export const printFirstItem = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// d) Function which will print to console the last element
export const printLastItem = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// e) Function which will print to console the largest number (You can check Math functions)
export const printLargestItem = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// f) Function which will print to console the smallest number (You can check Math functions)
export const printSmallestItem = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// g) Function which will print to console the sum of all numbers in array (You can check reduce function)
export const printSum = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// h) Function which will print to console the difference between the largest and the smallest number (You can check Math functions)
export const printSALDifference = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

};

// i) Function which will print to console the average of all numbers (You can check reduce function)
export const printAverage = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// j) Function which will print to console the index of largest number (You can check Math functions)
export const printLargestsIndex = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// k) Function which will print to console the even numbers (not the array of even numbers),
// if array doesn't contain any even number, show text "Even number isn't in array"
export const printEvenNums = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// l) Function which will multiple by 2 every number in array and print the array to console
// Example: printNumsMultipliedBy2([1,2,3]) -> [2,4,6]
export const printNumsMultipliedBy2 = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// m) Function which will print to console "Wow, this {smallest number} is very small" if array contains number smaller than 10
export const printMessageForSmallestBelow10 = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// n) Function which will return an array with duplicities of `numbers`
// Example: createDupes([1,2,3]) -> [1,1,2,2,3,3]
export const createDupes = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:


};

// o) Function which will received an array of numbers and will return an array of two other arrays (in this order) - one with even numbers, second with odd numbers
// Example: splitEvenOdds([1,2,3,4]) -> [[2, 4], [1, 3]]
export const splitEvenOdds = (numbers) => {
  // Your code:

  
};
